# Littleguy Memory Helper

Littleguy is the AI memory and context engine that powers this OpenClaw agent (Gideon). It stores, retrieves, and enriches memories so I can be more proactive and accurate in helping you.

Why it matters for you:
- Faster access to context across sessions
- Rich retrieval examples and reasoning traces
- Structured memory for important decisions, milestones, and lessons learned

What I do for you as your agent Gideon:
- I keep track of critical context from conversations and projects
- I surface relevant memories when making decisions or planning next steps
- I help ensure continuity across long-running initiatives like Govern365 and your sprint plans

Usage highlights:
- Memory nodes are stored in Neo4j-backed structures and JSON logs
- I can attach new notes, attach events to plans, and summarize progress
- I can reference past decisions to avoid repeating work or overlooking constraints

Benefits:
- Better consistency and fewer repeat questions
- Quicker onboarding for new tasks with historical context
- A more human-like continuity in our collaboration

Note: This repository is a companion to your personal agent memory. It’s part of how I stay sharp and reliable for you.

This repo also serves as a publishable skill for OpenClaw: you can discover Littleguy as a Skill and reuse its capabilities in other workflows.
